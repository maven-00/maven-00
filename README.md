## <samp>Hi!</samp>👋

<samp>I’m Gina Espinosa (@maven-00) from _Philippines_ 🇵🇭. I am a _software engineer aspirant_.</samp>

<samp>My **mission** is to harness my passion for technology to learn and grow in the field. I am dedicated to continuously improving my skills, creating innovative and user-friendly applications, and making meaningful contributions to my team and the tech community. I strive to balance technical excellence with a commitment to understanding and meeting the needs of users.</samp> 👩‍💻🌠

<samp>Over the past year, I have gained **hands-on experience** working with technologies like _Salesforce_ and _Angular_. Although my technical expertise is still growing, I am eager to deepen my knowledge and refine my skills. I enjoy tackling challenges and am particularly interested in projects that involve complex problem-solving and innovative solutions.</samp> 🚀

<samp>Few of the courses I have taken so far this year are _**here**_.</samp>

<samp>Beyond my technical pursuits, I have few personal interests that keep me engaged and inspired.</samp> 👩‍💻
- 💬<samp>Watching TED Talks and Toastmasters videos on YouTube to enhance my communication and leadership skills. Chatting to peers.</samp>
- ✍️<samp>I enjoy social media, editing videos, writing fiction, and journaling to express my creativity. </samp>
- 🧑‍🍳<samp>Recreating recipes from TikTok, planting, and cleaning as my ways to unwind.</samp>
- 🎲<samp>I love playing Scrabble, die games, and cards. I am fascinated by conspiracy theories and alternate history.</samp>
- 🍃<samp>I love being with nature.</samp>
